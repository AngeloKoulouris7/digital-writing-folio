### Biographical Note

My name is Angelo Koulouris, I am a 20 year old student living in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and currently studying a Bachelor of Arts (Creative Writing) at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I mostly work with writing screenplays and creative non-fiction, seeking to further my own understanding by exploring how contemporary writing intersects with modern technology, coding and digital spaces. My interests outside of this course involve watching movies and anime, listening to rock music and Formula 1.
