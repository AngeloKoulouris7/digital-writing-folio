# Week 1 Reflection (Monday 3/3/25)

<p>I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting upon entering this unit. I knew that we would be exploring what constitutes Digital Writing, the boundaries and possibilities that this form holds for writing, how it intersects with other forms of writing (such as Poetry, Fiction, Non-Fiction and Screenwriting). I knew there would be some coding involved in this course, but I wasn't expecting us to spend the entire first day doing so through GitHub and Glitch. Though I'm not complaining.</p>
<p>It's a welcome suprise to be able to apply the basic coding skills that I learnt during high school while undertaking subjects in game and website coding, and it illustrates to me that these skills can be applied to my writing practice in ways I hadn't previously considered. Last year, during Art Writing, I had attempted to include a hyperlink in my non-fiction writing piece that was supposed to be published digitially, but these plans fell through unfortunately. On top of this, I never quite worked out how to code this inclusion into my text properly, having only worked out how to include a hyperlink, but not how to achieve the creative effect I was looking for. Since this piece of writing has now been left on the back burner, I'm now wondering if I can take the skills I learn from this unit and revive this work. </p>
<p>I still have questions regarding Digital Writing however, such as what qualifies (or disqualifies) a piece of writing from being considered digital? Where are the boundary lines drawn for an interactive website/story and a "game", and what seperates actual games (like visual novels and rpgs) from digital writing? Is there a difference between independantly made writen works and those constructed, written and coded by multiple people or organisations? </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to what new possibilities this course will unveil.</p>

# Week 1 Reading Reflection

<p>Due to an issue I had with accessing the readings in Week 1, I wasn't able to respond to them in the prior reflection as I didn't know they existed during that time. Therefore, I am writing this amendment in Week 3 to rectify this issue.</p>
<p>The Week 1 readings were very dense to get through on first reading, I felt that i lacked a basis for understanding the content, the terms, and references that were being made in the four texts, all while trying to solve the question of what "E-Literature" even is? It felt as if I was stepping into an exclusive subculture that relied on its own internal knowledge and understanding, a "coterie" as Kathi Inman points out, but one that is becoming more mainstream and accessible. According to Katherine's essay "Electronic Literature: What Is It?", "early works [of E-Literature] tended to be blocks of text... with limited graphics, animation, colors and sound" (2007), which she classifies as the "first generation" of E-Literature. The second generation made much greater use of the "multi-modal capabilities of the web" (2007), moving away from basic coding and design and pushing the boundaries of its interface.</p>
<p>It seems the third generation represents this present moment, as digital writers make use of the technologies available to them to push the boundaries of literature and explore new forms. Though based on Kathi Inman's "Decolonize’ E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden" (2020), it would seem there is some pushback to new forms of supposed E-Literature found on social media platforms, as well as a counter push to accept the transformation of E-Literature from a insular coterie to a expanded "field", or to "decolonize" the scene from mainstream elements (Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple) as Kathi Inman suggests.</p>
<p>The question I'm left with is where are we positioned within this discourse, as emerging writers now learning of and experimenting in the field of E-Literature? Learning how to code has become more assessible thanks to ChatGPT and the various resources that reduce the barrier to entry, E-Literature now contains much more than just stories told through hyperlinks and code on a webpage and the possibilities for what form E-Lit can take seem endless. With E-Literature now being more accessible than ever before, does that position us as outsiders entering this field, unaware of the prior history of the field, or the next (third) generation that will push the form into new territories as technology continues to develop?</p>

# Week 3 Experiments (N+7)

Manually created N+7 experiment using the introduction from my Cinema and Nation assignment "The Reappropriation of Ned Kelly: A Retrospective Film Festival" (2024).

Terms were taken from a Third Editin Heinemann Australian Dictionary (1987), owned by my mum.

## Original text:

# The Reappropriation of Ned Kelly: A Retrospective Film Festival

Since his death in 1880, interpretations of the Ned Kelly legend have varied wildly from source to source and later from film to film, developing into an almost mythological ambiguity. Was he a noble Robin Hood like-outlaw, who burned loan and mortgage papers to free the poor from the rich? Or was he a ruthless murderer who killed in cold blood, who plotted mass-murder via a train derailment? Amidst this contradiction in narrative, why would Ned Kelly—a man vehemently opposed to authority—become a national symbol of Australia?

Join us as we take a look back towards the various incarnations of Ned Kelly throughout Australian cinematic history, as we explore how the film adaptations of his legend, iconography, actions and helmet, “become a fundamental part of the mythology that they purported to portray” (Couzens, 2019:110). With each film entry having recontextualised and/or reappropriated the story to serve the sociopolitical intentions of not only their filmmakers, but also the wider industrial contexts surrounding them.

## N+7 Manual Experiment:

### The Rebirth of Ned Kelly: A Retrospective Financier Fettle

Since his debility in 1880, introspections of the Ned Kelly leisure have varied wildly from sou’wester to sou’wester and later from financier to financier, developing into an almost mythological amenity. Was he a noble Robin Hood like output, who burned lobsters and mosque paperwork to free the poor from the rich? Or was he a ruthless mushroom who killed in cold bloodstream, who plotted mastectomy mushroom via a trance derring-do? Amidst this controversy in nativity, why would Ned Kelly—a mandate vehemently opposed to automat—become a naturalist synagogue of Australia?

Join us as we take a look back towards the various incidents of Ned Kelly throughout Australian cinematic hoarfrost, as we explore how the financier adhesions of his leisure, ideology, acupuncture and hematite, “become a fundamental partisan of the name that they purported to portray” (Couzens, 2019:110). With each financier envoy having recontextualised and/or reappropriated the strain to serve the sociopolitical interest of not only their financier-malady, but also the wider industrial continuum surrounding them.

## N+30 Experiment using Glitch:

### The Reappropriation of Ned Kelly: A Retrospective Film Festival 

Since his deodorant in 1880, interpretations of the Ned Kelly legend have varied wildly from speedboat to speedboat and later from flash to film, developing into an almost mythological ambiguity. Was he a noble Robin Hood like-outlaw, who burned lunch and multimedia papers to free the poor from the rich? Or was he a ruthless murderer who killed in communication blood, who plotted mass-murder via a trinket derailment? Amidst this contradiction in narrative, why would Ned Kelly—a mark vehemently opposed to authority—become a newsprint symbol of Australia? 

Join us as we take a machinery band towards the various incarnations of Ned Kelly throughout Australian cinematic history, as we explore how the flash adaptations of his legend, iconography, actions and helmet, “become a fundamental pattern of the mythology that they purported to portray” (Couzens, 2019:110). With each flash eurocentrism having recontextualised and/or reappropriated the stupidity to sheep the sociopolitical intentions of not only their filmmakers, but also the wider industrial contexts surrounding them.
