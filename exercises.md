# Week 1 Reflection (3/3/25)

<p>I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting upon entering this unit. I knew that we would be exploring what constitutes Digital Writing, the boundaries and possibilities that this form holds for writing, how it intersects with other forms of writing (such as Poetry, Fiction, Non-Fiction and Screenwriting). I knew there would be some coding involved in this course, but I wasn't expecting us to spend the entire first day doing so through GitHub and Glitch. Though I'm not complaining.</p>
<p>It's a welcome suprise to be able to apply the basic coding skills that I learnt during high school while undertaking subjects in game and website coding, and it illustrates to me that these skills can be applied to my writing practice in ways I hadn't previously considered. Last year, during Art Writing, I had attempted to include a hyperlink in my non-fiction writing piece that was supposed to be published digitially, but these plans fell through unfortunately. On top of this, I never quite worked out how to code this inclusion into my text properly, having only worked out how to include a hyperlink, but not how to achieve the creative effect I was looking for. Since this piece of writing has now been left on the back burner, I'm now wondering if I can take the skills I learn from this unit and revive this work. </p>
<p>I still have questions regarding Digital Writing however, such as what qualifies (or disqualifies) a piece of writing from being considered digital? Where are the boundary lines drawn for an interactive website/story and a "game", and what seperates actual games (like visual novels and rpgs) from digital writing? Is there a difference between independantly made writen works and those constructed, written and coded by multiple people or organisations? </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to what new possibilities this course will unveil.</p>
